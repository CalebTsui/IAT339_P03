                    <h2>WELCOME TO MY LITTLE CORNER OF THE INTERNET</h2>
                    <p>I am a third-year student at Simon Fraser University pursuing a major in Interactive Arts and Technology with a concentration in Design. Despite growing up as a dedicated STEM nerd, particularly in mathematics, my journey into design began unexpectedly when a high school friend invited me to join a Yearbook class with him. Ever since, I have been fascinated by the creative and thought process behind every design decision.</p>
            
                    <p>Building products and services that solve user’s challenges is why I study UX design. I don’t see myself as just an artist making pixels look good; I see myself as a problem solver using design and logic to craft solutions.</p>
            
                    <p>When I’m not online, you’ll find me taking film photos, doodling, or planning my next trip on a 14-page Google doc.</p>
